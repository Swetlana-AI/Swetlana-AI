# Hi, I'm Swetlana 👋

I do stuff with AI (mostly of creative/experimental nature). I'd describe myself as:

- 1/3 humanities (philosophy & writing)
- 1/3 art (videos, visuals, experiments)
- 1/3 tech (tools, scripts, systems)

I'm open to collaboration proposals, interviews, and generally to people who do something (reach out!).
