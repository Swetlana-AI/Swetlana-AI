# Hi, I'm Swetlana 👋

I do stuff with AI (mostly of creative/experimental nature). I'd describe myself as:

- 1/3 humanities (philosophy, big picture, writing)
- 1/3 art (videos, visuals, experiments)
- 1/3 tech (tools, scripts, systems)

I'm definitely not a developer in the classical sense. But I'm not exclusively an artist either. These days I'm doing a lot with .md files and Telegram bots.

I'm open to collaboration proposals, interviews, and generally to people who do something (reach out!).

Easiest way to reach me is via X/Twitter: [@Swetlanaai](https://x.com/Swetlanaai)
